## Testing
We use Intern.js for testing. It's awesome, easy, and fun. Please use it.

## Code Style
Code style is enforced via the build system. So do yourself a favor and build frequently.
Tip: `grunt watch` will rebuild and lint the codebase when you save any project files. If it's not doing that for you, double-check the file paths inside of `Gruntfile.js`.
